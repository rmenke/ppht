# PPHT -- A generic C++ Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform (PPHT) line segment detector

A header-only algorithm implementing the PPHT line segment detection algorithm.  This implementation follows the intent of the original paper in that line segment candidates are searched for only when the probability that the candidate was generated by random noise (the null hypothesis) falls below a user-supplied threshold.
