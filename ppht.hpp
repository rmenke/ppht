 *
 * PPHT is a header-only library that implements the Probabilistic
 * Progressive Hough Transform (PPHT) Line Segment Detection
 * algorithm. This library uses the dynamic threshold approach
 * proposed by the authors of the original paper.
 *
 * @subsection theory About the Algorithm
 *
 * The formula for a line @f$L@f$ passing through the point @f$(x_0,
 * y_0)@f$ is @f$\Delta y(x-x_0) = \Delta x(y-y_0).@f$ Unlike the
 * traditional slope-intercept form, this equation handles vertical
 * lines. Assume @f$(x_0, y_0)@f$ is the point where the perpendicular
 * @f$P@f$ to the line that passes through the origin intersects
 * @f$L.@f$ @f$P@f$ makes an angle @f$\theta@f$ with the x-axis;
 * therefore, the angle @f$L@f$ makes with the axis is
 * @f$\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}.@f$ From this, we get @f$\Delta
 * y=\sin(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})=\cos\theta@f$ and @f$\Delta
 * x=\cos(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2})=-\sin\theta.@f$ We can also let
 * @f$x_0=\rho\cos\theta@f$ and @f$y_0=\rho\sin\theta@f$ for some
 * unknown @f$\rho.@f$ Plugging these values into the original
 * equation and solving for @f$\rho@f$ yields:
 *
 * @f{align}{
 * 0 &= \Delta y(x-x_0) - \Delta x(y-y_0)\\
 *   &= (x-x_0)\cos\theta + (y-y_0)\sin\theta\\
 *   &= (x-\rho\cos\theta)\cos\theta + (y-\rho\sin\theta)\sin\theta\\
 *   &= x\cos\theta - \rho\cos^2\theta + y\sin\theta - \rho\sin^2\theta\\
 *   &= x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta - \rho\\
 * \rho &= x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta
 * @f}
 *
 * This implies that every line can be defined by the pair
 * @f$(\theta,\rho)@f$ and for a given @f$x@f$, @f$y@f$, and
 * @f$\theta@f$, @f$\rho@f$ can be calculated. If we restrict
 * @f$0\le\theta<\pi@f$ then every line has a unique representation as
 * a point in a different space. Equivalently, every point in
 * @f$xy@f$-space is a sinusoid in @f$\theta\rho@f$-space. This is
 * known as the <em>Hough transform.</em> Given a set of points in
 * @f$xy@f$-space, if their sinusoids intersect at a point in
 * @f$\theta\rho@f$-space then that point represents the line on which
 * all of the points are located.  Locating those intersections is the
 * key to the <em>Hough Transform Line Detection</em> algorithm.
 *
 * The algorithm works by quantizing the @f$\theta@f$ and @f$\rho@f$
 * values, iterating over the possible values of @f$\theta@f$ for
 * every set pixel, finding the quantized value for @f$\rho@f$, and
 * incrementing a counter in an accumulator array.  The peaks in this
 * array are the lines on which a large number of pixels reside.
 * Locating these peaks is where the algorithm has the most trouble.
 *
 * <em>Progressive Hough Transform</em> algorithms work by randomly
 * sampling the set pixels in a bitmap image and incrementing the
 * counters.  When a counter reaches a given threshold (either fixed
 * or computed) the algorithm pauses, scans the line corresponding to
 * the counter, and removes the pixels from the bitmap for any line
 * segments found.
 *
 * The <em>Probabilistic Progressive Hough Transform</em> (PPHT) uses
 * combinatorics to determine the threshold for a counter to trigger a
 * scan.  It starts by assuming the null hypothesis: the image is a
 * collection of random pixels.  Since each vote increments a counter
 * in each column @f$(\theta)@f$ of the accumulator, the expected
 * value for any counter after @f$v@f$ votes would be @f$E[n] =
 * \frac{v}{\rho_{\max}}@f$, where @f$\rho_{\max}@f$ is the height of
 * the counter matrix.
 *
 * The simplifying assumption that we make is that the counters are
 * selected by a uniform process.  For this, a binomial distribution
 * would be used to calculate the probability of a bin containing
 * @f$n@f$ after @f$v@f$ voting rounds.  However, the probability mass
 * function for a binomial distribution is expensive to compute, so
 * instead we approximate the probability by using the Poisson
 * distribution instead.  Setting @f$\lambda = E[n]@f$, we get
 *
 * @f{align}{
 *     P(n)&=\frac{\lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\lambda}\\
 *         &=\frac{\lambda^n}{\Gamma(n+1)}e^{-\lambda}\\
 * \ln P(n)&=\ln(\lambda^n)-\ln\Gamma(n+1)-\lambda\\
 *         &=n\cdot\ln(\lambda)-\ln\Gamma(n+1)-\lambda
 * @f}
 *
 * If the value @f$P(n)@f$ is less than a predetermined threshold
 * @f$t@f$ -- or equivalently @f$\ln P(N)<\ln(t)@f$ -- then we reject
 * the null hypothesis and search along the line described by
 * @f$(\theta,\rho)@f$ for a line segment.
